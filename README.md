## About me 🍭

I am a third year undergraduate Computer Engineering student at Nirma University. I am passionate about working with data — from analyzing and visualizing complex datasets to uncovering patterns and trends that drive actionable insights. My experience spans across relational and non-relational databases such as **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**. I enjoy integrating **AI tools** to enhance productivity and building **machine learning models** to solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in **applied mathematics** and **graph theory**, I bring an analytical mindset to every project, aiming to design intelligent, data-driven solutions.
